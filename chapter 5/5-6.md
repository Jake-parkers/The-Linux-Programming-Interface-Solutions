fd1 = open(file, O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR); 
open `file`, in read/write mode clearing out the contents and putting the offset at 0;

fd2 = dup(fd1);
duplicate fd1, and store the fd in fd2. Both fd1 and fd2 are the same and share the same offset

fd3 = open(file, O_RDWR);
open `file` in read/write mode
write(fd1, "Hello,", 6);
`file` has content "Hello,"

write(fd2, "world", 6); 
`file` has content "Hello,world"

lseek(fd2, 0, SEEK_SET); 
set offset of `file` via fd2 to the beginning

write(fd1, "HELLO,", 6); 
since fd1 and fd2 share the same offset, `file` will have content HELLO,world

write(fd3, "Gidday", 6);
`file` will have content Gidday,world
