## Question
Compile the program in Listing 6-1 (mem_segments.c), and list its size using ls â€“l. Although the program contains an array (mbuf) that is around 10 MB in size, the executable file is much smaller than this. Why is this?

## Answer
The array `mbuf` although around 10MB in size is not explicitly initialized and hence resides in the uninitialized memory segment of memory. When a program is stored on disk, it is not necessary to allocate space for uninitialized data since it won't be used when the program starts until it is actually initialized. The executable after compilation merely records the location and size required for the uninitialized data segment and this space is allocated by the program loader at run time.
